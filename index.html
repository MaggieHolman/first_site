           <p>Lucy is a 17-year-old calico that I’ve had since I was 5,
             she has pretty much grown up with me my whole life. Even though she’s old she’s still
             kickin’ it and enjoys running around the house at 4am. </p>

           <p>Her favorite foods include anything but her kibble.
             She enjoys sunbathing and long naps, along with lots of petting.
              However, she hates getting her stomach rubbed. </p>
