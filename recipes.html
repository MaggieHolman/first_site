             taco bell beef seasoning. Try the crunchwrap supreme because once you try it,
              you can never go back to eating real tacos! It's the TACO BELL EFFECT</div>

        <div> Taco Bell's beef and cheese are seasoned to the core.

        <div> With beef and cheese aside, they decorate the crunchwrap 
            supreme with healthy vegetables to balance out the oilyness of the meat.
             They add diced tomatoes, lettuce, sour cream and melted cheese. All of 
             the flavors go so well together and bursting with flavor.</div>

        <a class = "center" href="Images/Crunchwrap_Supreme.png.png" ><img src ="Images/Crunchwrap_Supreme.png.png" width = '200' alt="Food"></a>
        <div> Taco Bell has an iconic fold especially for the crunchwrap supreme. It
             stands out from any other taco created by them and as well as any other 
             mexican place. Who would've thought to create such a meal by folding a quesadilla into a pentagon shape?</div>

    <div>
        <a class = "center" href="Images/Beef_Cheese.png.png" ><img src ="Images/Beef_Cheese.png.png" width = '200' alt="Food"></a>
        <div> What makes this dish more iconic than it already is is how they grill it.
             They don't deep fry it or oven bake it except they pan fry it. They panfry
              the crunchwrap supreme until it gets golden cripsy brown.</div>
